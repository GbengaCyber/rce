# Remote Code Execution Detection / Device Isolation 

## üéØ Objective

This project demonstrates how to detect Remote Code Execution (RCE) events on a Windows VM using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and Kusto Query Language (KQL). It also showcases how to isolate a compromised device.


###  Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- MDE Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

### üîß Create a Windows VM in Azure

    Provision a Windows 10/11 or Server 2019+ VM.

    Size: Small (B1s or similar).

    Public IP enabled to allow scanning (for simulation purposes).

    Enable RDP for access.

  ### üî• Disable the Windows Firewall

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: Disabling the firewall is for educational/demo purposes only. This exposes the VM to external threats for visibility.

    Run wf.msc ‚Üí Turn off Domain, Private, and Public firewall.

### üõ°Ô∏è Onboard VM to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)

    Use MDE onboarding package for Azure VMs.

    Verify onboarding at: Microsoft 365 Defender Portal

    Run sample hunting query to confirm logs:

### üß™ Simulate RCE (Remote Code Execution)

We'll simulate an RCE attempt using PowerShell to download and install 7-Zip silently.

### üõë Create Detection Rule

    Go to Advanced Hunting ‚Üí Detection Rules ‚Üí Create custom rule

    Use the above query as the condition.

    Choose Alert & Isolate Device as the response.

### üßº Isolate Compromised Device 

Wait/search for logs. When the logs appear, your machine should be isolated and you can move to the next step. If you can no longer connect to your VM, it‚Äôs possible the Detection Rule already executed and isolated your VM. That was the case for me:

Browse to your VM within the MDE Portal (https://security.microsoft.com/machines)
Select the VM and then click the three dots menu. If it‚Äôs isolated, observe that you can release your VM from isolation here. For now, click ‚ÄúAction Center‚Äù and check out the Investigation Package that was created (if it‚Äôs ready).

Feel free to look through the investigation package. The investigation package is a comprehensive collection of data and artifacts, including process trees, file and registry changes, network connections, event logs, and memory dumps, generated from virtual machines to facilitate detailed analysis and investigation of security incidents.

## üöÄ  Conclusion

    Proactive Detection: By leveraging KQL and the MDE platform, organizations can quickly identify signs of RCE attempts and other malicious activities on their network.

    Automated Response: Using MDE's built-in capabilities, it's possible to automate device isolation and stop an attack in real time, reducing the impact of a potential security breach.

    Forensic Analysis: The investigation package created upon isolation provides valuable insights into the attack, allowing for a deeper analysis of the adversary's actions and potential next steps in mitigation.

This project emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring, early detection, and automated response in safeguarding corporate networks from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. By leveraging powerful tools like MDE, KQL, and automated isolation, organizations can better defend themselves against remote code execution and other advanced attack vectors.

As cybersecurity threats evolve, it‚Äôs crucial to adapt and continuously refine detection mechanisms. This project serves as a foundation for building a comprehensive endpoint protection strategy and showcases the benefits of integrating threat detection, response, and investigation workflows in a unified security platform.
